# Release notes for fcp 0.25

## signal_parser.c and signal_parser.h

[signal_parser.c](https://gitlab.com/projectofst/software10e/-/blob/feat/fcp/v20/fcp/skel/signal_parser.c)
and
[signal_parser.h](https://gitlab.com/projectofst/software10e/-/blob/feat/fcp/v20/fcp/skel/signal_parser.h).

The signal parser interface has suffered major changes. The decode functions
now take the `fcp_signal_t` struct as a parameter instead of individual start,
length, scale and offset parameters.

```
typedef struct _signal {
	uint16_t start;
	uint16_t length;
	double scale;
	double offset;
	fcp_type_t type;
	fcp_endianess_t endianess;
} fcp_signal_t;
```

The `fcp_signal_t` now includes the signal type and endianess. Check the
`fcp_type_t` and `fcp_endianess_t` enums for possible values.

Example usage:
```
uint64_t value = fcp_decode_signal_uint64_t(msg, 
	(fcp_signal_t) {
		.start = start, 
		.length = length, 
		.scale = scale, 
		.offset = offset, 
		.type= type 
		.endianess = endianess
	}
);
```

The obvious advantage of this change is the support for big endian signals.

## C codegen

The `fcp c_gen` command was updated to make use of the new signal_parser
functions.

Those that make use of `c_gen` should not notice any changes **except** for a
substancial increase in program size.

If this increase in program size is troublesome remember that the compilation
of devices can be stopped by defining: NO_DCU, NO_MASTER, NO_IIB, ...

## Author note

This release was a bit rushed due to the need to support big endian values in
Xsens. If you encounter any problems with decoding and encoding fcp signals please
notify me via discord.
